README – AI Smart Reader Intelligent Web Accessibility Assistant using NLP, OCR, and Voice Navigation

Project Overview
AI Smart Reader is a browser-based accessibility tool designed to help visually impaired users and fast readers consume webpage content more efficiently. It intelligently extracts meaningful text, summarizes content using NLP, performs OCR on images, and provides voice-based navigation.

Key Features:
1.	Intelligent Content Extraction 2. AI Summarization (NLP)
2.	Text-to-Speech Narration 4. Hover-to-Read Interaction 5. Voice Navigation
3.	Interactive Element Detection 7. OCR Integration
4.	Page Summary Mode

System Architecture:
1.	Content Capture Layer (DOM extraction, OCR) 2. NLP Layer (Summarization, Semantic Matching) 3. Voice Interaction Layer (SpeechRecognition, Fuzzy Search) 4. Output Layer (TTS, Overlay UI) 5. Browser Extension Shell (Manifest V3)


Workflow: Extract → Clean → Summarize → Preview Overlay → TTS → User Interaction → OCR Support
→ Voice Navigation

Installation:
1.	Open chrome://extensions 2. Enable Developer Mode
2.	Load Unpacked Extension


Keyboard & Voice Controls: P – Page summary
Shift + P – Priority-only summary 1 / 2 / 3 – Priority marking Space – Pause/Resume
