# Projects

A curated collection of academic, research, and applied software projects developed during my graduate studies and independent work.

This repository serves as a **project hub** — each folder represents a focused project with its own documentation, scope, and implementation details.

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each project lives in its **own folder** with a dedicated `README.md` explaining:
- the problem statement
- system design
- technologies used
- outcomes and learnings
